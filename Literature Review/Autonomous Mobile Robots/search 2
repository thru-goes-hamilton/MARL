AB  - Purpose This study aims to investigate locomotion mechanisms of different urban search and rescue (USAR) robots currently being researched or commercially available on the market. Design/methodology/approach USAR robots are categorized by the type of their mobility. Detailed illustration and analysis have been given for each USAR robot in the paper. Findings The paper finds that none of current USAR robots can practically and autonomously carry out rescue work in a complex and unstructured environment. Hence, responding to the practical requirements of highly challenging USAR tasks, a team of USAR robots based on different locomotion mechanisms may be a good solution to undertake rescue activities. Research limitations/implications The paper provides guidance in the design of future USAR robots. Originality/value The paper investigates locomotion mechanisms of different USAR robots in detail.
